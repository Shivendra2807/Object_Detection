# Object_Detection
Implemented in Python using opencv

This code detects objects in the input image and save the detected objects in a folder.

We can explicitly mention the width and height of the object which is of interest. This is done with the help of bounding box concept.
Example: If the box height is >20, widht is >80, then only save it as a box in the output folder

This object detection code can be widely applied to different areas. I personally used it for performing Pick and Place operation from my UR 10 Robot Arm.
